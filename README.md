# Auto_PowerManager
my final year school project

## Disclaimer
almost finished, just touches away from final product.

if you want to try it: ConsoleApplication41 is the Core program, WindowsFormsApplication5 is the GUI program.

as long as you have intel extreme tuning utility installed, core program will run automatically.

use GUI program to monitor stuff.

be my guest!

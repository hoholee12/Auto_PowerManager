## HOW TO USE?
ConsoleApplication41 is the Core program, WindowsFormsApplication5 is the GUI program.

task scheduling the core program, and putting GUI program in the startmenu folder is recommended.

make sure you only have a intel(R) integrated GPU and have intel(R) extreme tuning utility installed on your system. (otherwise there is no point in using this software)

core program will run by itself without any support. you can use GUI program to control the core program, and get status information.

be my guest!
